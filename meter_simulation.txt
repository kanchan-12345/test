1. meter simulation
    check -->   if any meter_ID is present in local_storage --> already logged in
                if no meter_ID present in local_storage then go to login page 

        1. voltage
        2. power (p = VI)



2. get bill
    check -->   if any meter_ID is present in local_storage --> already logged in
                if no meter_ID present in local_storage then go to login page 

        - button named (get bill) --> sends a request to server to `get-bill` route --> he will get the bill and power consumed
            now show him the result (bill , power_consumed)
